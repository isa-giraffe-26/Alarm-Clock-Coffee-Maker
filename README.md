# Alarm-Clock-Coffee-Maker

Overview: This project is for those like myself who need coffee in the morning to wake up, but must get out of bed to do so. The alarm clock coffee maker is an alaram clock that when it goes off, a pump activates, pouring coffee into a mug. The alarm won't go off until the coffee mug has been taken off the stand. This solves the problem of needing coffee to get out of bed but being too tired to do so in the first place because you have no coffee in your system.
A demonstration of the working prototype is found in my 2 minute video on my Maker Porfolio.
