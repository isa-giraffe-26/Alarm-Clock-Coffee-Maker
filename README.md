# Alarm-Clock-Coffee-Maker

Overview: This project is for those like myself who need coffee in the morning to wake up, but must get out of bed to do so. The alarm clock coffee maker is an alaram clock that when it goes off, a pump activates, pouring coffee into a mug. The alarm won't go off until the coffee mug has been taken off the stand. This solves the problem of needing coffee to get out of bed but being to tired to get out of bed in the first place because you have no coffee in your system.
The required components that apply to this code include the following: Arduino Uno, RTC Module 4-Digit Seven Segment Display, Limit Switch, Buttons, Buzzer, 12V Power Supply, 12V Relay, 12V Pump. A demonstartion of the working project is shown in my 2 minute video.
