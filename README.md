# Alarm-Clock-Coffee-Maker

Overview: This project is for those like myself need coffee in the morning to wake up, but must get out of bed to do so. The alarm clock coffee maker is an alram clock that when it goes off, a pump activates, pouring coffee into a mug. The alarm won't go off until the coffee mug has been taken off the stand, ensuring that by the time the user takes their coffee from the comfort of their bed, they are already awake since the alarm was beeping for a long time.

The required components that apply to this code include the following: Arduino Uno, RTC Module 4-Digit Seven Segment Display, Limit Switch, Buttons, Buzzer, 12V Power Supply, 12V Relay, 12V Pump. A demonstartion of the working project is shown in my 2 minute video.
